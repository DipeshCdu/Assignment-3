=== OOP CONCEPTS EXPLANATION ===

1. ENCAPSULATION:
   - Each model class (TextToImageModel, SentimentModel) hides internal state (pipeline, model object) and exposes only necessary methods.

2. POLYMORPHISM:
   - Both models implement the same interface (load_model, predict) but with different internal logic.

3. METHOD OVERRIDING:
   - Each model overrides get_usage_example() to provide model-specific examples.

4. COMPOSITION:
   - The GUI uses ModelSelector to manage model instances instead of inheriting AI functionality.

5. MULTIPLE INHERITANCE & DECORATORS:
   - Not heavily used in this simplified version, but could be added (e.g., LoggingMixin, @log_execution).
